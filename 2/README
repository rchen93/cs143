Had to fix part B's insertAndSplit() functions because we had the wrong pid for the new non-leaf node.
Stored rootPid and treeHeight at PageId 0, so the nodes in our B+ tree began at 1,2,3,....

The work was divided through the use of pair programming.
We used GitHub to keep track of our code when we programmed individually.
We feel that we could have had better comments for each other in order to make
understanding our code better.
