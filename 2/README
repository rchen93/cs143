Our nodes were designed to hold the keycount of the node at the very first position in the buffer.
We made some helper functions such as shifting the entries, and deleting the entries from the buffer.
For insertandsplit of nonleafnodes, we used an insertion sort algorithm to figure out where the key should go
because we can't simply "insert" into a full buffer.

The work was divided through the use of pair programming.
We used GitHub to keep track of our code when we programmed individually.
We feel that we could have had better comments for each other in order to make
understanding our code better.
