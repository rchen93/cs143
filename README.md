This is a repository for the projects assigned in Professor Cho's Winter 2014 CS143 class.
The README.txt contained in each project was for submission purposes.
The following projects will have their minimum requirements listed, and all links used

<h3> Project 1A: PHP Web Calculator </h3>
=====

We built a small Web calculator application in PHP to become familiarized with HTML and PHP.
Requirements: 
<ul>
<li> Supports +,-,* and / operators </li>
<li> Supports integer (1234) and real (12.34) numbers </li>
<li> Does not support parantheses </li>
<li> Handle errors gracefully, i.e., do not display raw PHP error messages </li>
</ul>

<h3> Project 1B: Web Query Interface </h3>
=====

We built a web query interface that allowed users to enter MySQL queries for our MySQL database.
We were allowed to assume that users would not attempt SQL injection attacks; thus, we did not use
the mysql_real_escape_string() function when processing the MySQL queries.

<h3> Project 1C: Hobo IMDB </h3>

<h3> Project 2: Bruinbase </h3>
