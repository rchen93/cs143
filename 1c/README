We met all the criteria.
Additional feature we implemented is generating a valid random id for B1 and B2
pages, so the information will be different everytime.

The work was divided through the use of pair programming.
We used GitHub to keep track of our code when we programmed individually.
Kailin mainly worked on the I1, I2, I3 and aesthetics of webpages.
Roger mainly worked on the remaining pages.
We feel that we could have had better comments for each other in order to make
understanding our code better.
